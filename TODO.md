# TODO's: 

## Misc.
cf. Source files.


## Streamline the Process
Maybe make it such that the user can

1. run ``qngen.py`` (for a new set of questions, formatted and placed into the right path)
2. run ``mcq.py`` to solve the latest batch of questions
3. ???
4. \<imagine...\>

We could combine both files or make a mini-library, but that would be for the iteration after that.

## Web Version
(hmm..., simpe node server -> host a html with a js script to read and display generated questions? dynamically generate questions? -> need to keep track of cost and abuse, or pre-generate a number of questions and segment into short batches -> selection menu, etc.)
